	Displays `Event`s with height proportional to the event's length, laying them side by side should their times overlap.

	`contentView`: Holds all events and time lines. Direct child of `scrollView`. `UIScrollView`s should only have one child (its content), so this acts as a container for all events.
	`eventViews`: Holds a reference to each event view, so they can be destroyed on redraw. Each event view has its value as the corresponding event so the event can be passed to `DetailsVC` on click. Time lines are not redrawn so no reference to them is skept.
	`HOURS`: List of hours to display. Should be the full range of start/end times for events. Hours range: [START_HOUR, END_HOUR], inclusive. Hours wrap around, from 7~23, then 0~2.
	`START_HOUR`: The earliest hour an event can start.
	`END_HOUR`: The latest hour an event can end. Note that this is in AM; END_HOUR must < START_HOUR.
	`didLayout`: True if layout of subviews was completed. Used to ensure layout initialization is only done once.

		Slot = column which events are assigned. Starts from 0.
		
		Specifically:
		1. Finds the best slot to put this event in based on conflicts with other events. If all available slots are full, creates a new slot. The slots in which events are placed are returned to earlier events in case its margins are updated (the new event shrinks the previous event's width when a new slot is created).
		2. Creates the event cell (`container`).
		3. If there are more events, calculate their slots too. If the new event won't overlap with this one, it automatically is assigned the entire width (numSlots = 1).
		4. Sets event margins, text, listener. Stores in appropriate data structures.
		5. Returns numSlots and eventForSlot to the parent with relevant new positioning info.
		
		- parameters:
			- numSlots: Number of slots currently available to events. Starts from 1.
			- eventForSlot: A map of events occupying a given slot. Note: slots CAN be empty (return nil).
